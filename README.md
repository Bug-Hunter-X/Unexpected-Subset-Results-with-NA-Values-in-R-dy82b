# Unexpected Subset Results with NA Values in R

This repository demonstrates a common issue in R programming related to how NA (Not Available) values are handled in logical comparisons during subsetting operations.  The `bug.R` file contains code that produces unexpected results when subsetting a data frame based on a condition involving NA values. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.R`.

## Problem Description

When subsetting a data frame using logical indexing in R, comparisons involving `NA` values often lead to unexpected behavior. The standard logical comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `==`, etc.) return `NA` when compared to `NA`, which can affect the subset operation, not always producing the expected output.  This can cause subtle but critical errors in data analysis and manipulation. 

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly handling `NA` values using functions like `is.na()` to filter them out or treat them appropriately.
